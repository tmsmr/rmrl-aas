# rmrl-aas
*reMarkable Rendering Library - as a Service*

## What is this?
This is basically a wrapper for [@rscholl](https://www.github.com/rscholl)'s `rmrl` Python package (https://github.com/rschroll/rmrl) to make the `render` call available via HTTP. So, whole credits go to him - I just put things together ðŸ˜€.
